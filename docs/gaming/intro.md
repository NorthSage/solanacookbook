# Intro into gaming on Solana

The gaming space in the Solana ecosystem is growing. 
Integrating with Solana can provide many benefits for games, including:
- Allowing players to own and trade their assets via NFTs
- Build a real in-game economy
- Create composable game programs
- Let players compete for valuable assets

Solana is built for games and with its 400ms block time and incredible fast confirmations it can be thought of as a realtime database, free for all, which you can built your game on. 
Perfect genres are strategy games, city builders, any round based game and many more. 

But you don't need to put everything on chain, easy integrations can also be done with a smaller integration using NFTs that represent game items for example.

The fees for transactions extremely cheap, and many tools and SDKs available to start building today. You can build your game in [Javascript](https://docs.solana.com/de/developing/clients/javascript-api) and Canvas, [Flutter](https://github.com/espresso-cash/espresso-cash-public), or use one of the Solana Game SDKs for the two biggest game engines, [UnitySDK](./versioned-transactions.md), [UnrealSDK](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/FoundationKit) and more [Game SDKs](./gaming/game-sdks).

There are multiple ways to integrate Solana into your game:

1. Give players NFTs for in game items or use them as characters. [Nfts in games](./nfts-in-games)
2. Use Sol- or an SPL-token for in-app purchases or micro payments in the game. (TODO: See Monetization + link to use case)
3. Use the player's wallet to authenticate them in the game.
4. Run tournaments and pay out crypto rewards to our players. 
5. Develop the game completely on-chain to be able to reward your players in every step they take. [Hello world unity](./gaming/hello-world-unity)
